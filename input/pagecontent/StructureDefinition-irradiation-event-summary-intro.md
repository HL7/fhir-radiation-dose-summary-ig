Irradiation Event Summary profile defines an overview of an irradiation event, performed by a modality and related to a specific procedure. It is defined in CT SR by "<i> a single continuous actuation of the equipment's irradiation switch, from the start of the loading time of the first pulse until the loading time trailing edge of the final pulse</i>", within the [TID 10013 CT Irradiation Event Data](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/sect_TID_10013.html){:target="_blank"} from DICOM standard. The same definition is used within the [TID 10003 Irradiation Event X-Ray Data](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/sect_TID_10003.html){:target="_blank"}. 

This profile is not aiming to report all the information related to an irradiation event, but only the most relevant information. Only few parameters are important to be reported, identified in [Minimal Radiation Information](background.html#minimal-radiation-information) section, from the page [Background](background.html). 

The Irradiation Event Summary profile is an abstract profile, and is extended in this IG by the following profile: [CT Irradiation Event Summary](StructureDefinition-ct-irradiation-event-summary.html).
