# Warning on codeSystem
Error from server: Unable to provide support for code system http://ncit.nci.nih.gov

# The FHIR DICOM Package is not a standard IG and it fails this validation check
The canonical URL for an Implementation Guide must point directly to the implementation guide resource, not to the Implementation Guide as a whole

# The DICOM value type codes only make sense in the context of this IG.
Reference to draft CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/radiation-dose-summary/CodeSystem/dicom-identifier-type|0.1.0

# The DICOM value type codes only make sense in the context of this IG.
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# This element is not included in this IG
An HTML fragment from the set [cross-version-analysis.xhtml, cross-version-analysis-inline.xhtml] is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide

# This IG was written against the 1.0 version of IPS. Aligning with current version is planned for final text version.
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.uv.ips#1.0.0 released on 2020-05-19, but the most recent appropriate version is 1.1.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# This code value is still used in the related DICOM SR template
The code '349358000' is valid but is not active

# This System is used in an example and does not need to be defined in FHIR terminology
URL value 'urn:pid:ipdauth1' does not resolve

# This System is used in an example and does not need to be defined in FHIR terminology
URL value 'urn:prid:ipractauth1' does not resolve

# The mapping target is a DICOM value set that is not formally defined in FHIR
URL value 'http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.4.11.html' does not resolve

# The mapping target is a DICOM value set that is not formally defined in FHIR
URL value 'http://dicom.nema.org/medical/Dicom/2016b/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.5.html' does not resolve

# This repeating is intentional
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# This will be revisited in the final text version of this IG
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# This extension is part of the baseline 4.0.1 Observation and not specialized in this IG
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

# The mapping target is a DICOM value set that is not formally defined in FHIR
Unable to expand included value set 'http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/sect_CID_18.html%
