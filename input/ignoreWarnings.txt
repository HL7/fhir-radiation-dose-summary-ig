# This code system reflects DICOM concepts. A project is underway to create a DICOM codeset that would include these codes. A THO exemption has been requested in the interim
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# The FHIR DICOM Package is not a standard IG and it fails this validation check
The canonical URL for an Implementation Guide must point directly to the implementation guide resource, not to the Implementation Guide as a whole

# This element is not included in this IG
An HTML fragment from the set [cross-version-analysis.xhtml, cross-version-analysis-inline.xhtml] is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide

# This code value is still used in the related DICOM SR template
The code '349358000' is valid but is not active

# This System is used in an example and does not need to be defined in FHIR terminology
URL value 'urn:pid:ipdauth1' does not resolve

# This System is used in an example and does not need to be defined in FHIR terminology
URL value 'urn:prid:ipractauth1' does not resolve

# This repeating is intentional
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# This will be revisited in the final text version of this IG
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# This extension is part of the baseline 4.0.1 Observation and not specialized in this IG
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

# The DICOM package does not conform to usual IG structure
The URL should refer directly to the ImplementationGuide resource (e.g. include '/ImplementationGuide/')

# The base valueset is a DICOM valuset (CID_18) and contains codes that cannot be expanded by the FHIR IG builder at present
%Unable to expand included value set 'http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/sect_CID_18.html'%

# The base valueset is a DICOM valuset (CID_25) and contains codes that cannot be expanded by the FHIR IG builder at present
%Unable to expand included value set 'http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/sect_CID_25.html'%

# This code is used in the base Composition resource and not directly in this IG
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '3.0.0', found versions: 2.0.0, 3.0.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode' to 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode|3.0.0'
