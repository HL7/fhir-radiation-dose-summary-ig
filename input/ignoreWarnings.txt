# Warning on codeSystem
Error from server: Unable to provide support for code system http://ncit.nci.nih.gov

# The FHIR DICOM Package is not a standard IG and it fails this validation check
The canonical URL for an Implementation Guide must point directly to the implementation guide resource, not to the Implementation Guide as a whole

# The DICOM value type codes only make sense in the context of this IG.
Reference to draft CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/radiation-dose-summary/CodeSystem/dicom-identifier-type|0.1.0

# The DICOM value type codes only make sense in the context of this IG.
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
